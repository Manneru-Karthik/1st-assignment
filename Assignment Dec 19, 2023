1. Import the random module and generate a random number between 1 and 100. Write code to ask the user to guess the number within 5 tries. Give them hints if their guess is too high or too low.
   Bonus: Can you add a scoring system where the user gets more points for guessing the number in fewer tries?	

2. Create a text file named "fruits.txt" and write your favorite fruits (one per line) to the file.

3. Define a function that takes a name as input and returns a greeting message like "Hello, [name]!". Call the function with your name and print the returned message.
   Bonus: Can you modify the function to greet the user differently based on the time of day (e.g., "Good morning" in the morning)?

4. Write code to extract all the numbers from a string like "Hello 123 World 456!" and store them in a list.

5. Write a function that takes a string as input and returns a new string with the characters reversed.

6. Write code to count the number of times each letter appears in a given sentence and print the letter that occurs the most often.

7. Write a program that prints a square of stars using nested loops. For example, if the user inputs 5, print a 5x5 square of stars.

8. Write code that takes the user's favourite day of the week as input and prints a different message based on the chosen day (e.g., "Happy Monday!" or "Relaxing Sunday!").

9. Write a program that converts a temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit or vice versa based on the user's choice.

10. Write a program that helps the user track their expenses and income for a week. Allow them to add new entries, remove entries, and calculate their total spending and remaining budget.

11. Instead of generating a random number, write a program that guesses a number chosen by the user by asking yes/no questions about its range and divisibility properties.

12. Write code to remove specific elements from a list based on certain conditions (e.g., remove all even numbers, remove elements shorter than 5 characters).

13. Write code that takes a string and counts the number of vowels and consonants it contains.

14. Write a program that converts a sentence into Pig Latin. In Pig Latin, you move the first letter of each word to the end and add "ay". For example, "Hello world" becomes "elloHay orldway".

15. Write a program that lets the user add and remove items from a shopping list stored in a list.
